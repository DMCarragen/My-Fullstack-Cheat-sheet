    <h1>Links and Images on Html</h1>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Links</strong> on html are used with the tag a href="internal or external link"> the name of the links button and afterwards close the tag a. </p>
    <p>The link needs a path to the destiny page, it could be an URL in the case of an external link whit it's protocol"https".</p>
    <p>whereas in the case of using a <strong>internal link</strong> the path is written from the page of origin  to the destiny page including their relationship through the root directory, we use ../ at the start of a internal link as  reference to the root directory.</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>To put an image whitout much personalization we use the tag img(<strong> this tag isn't wrapped</strong>).</p>
    <p>In the same img tag we write  src="path/to/image", and we also give the img tag a alt attribute which describes the image in cases where it can't be loaded.</p>
